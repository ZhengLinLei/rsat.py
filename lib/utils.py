	Arguments:

	Examples:
		>>> binary_search(2, [0, 2, 3])

	"""
	Tests whether a number is prime using a deterministic version of the Miller-
	Rabin primality test. Optionally tests whether the specified number is a 
	prime probabistically up to a given tolerance using the regular version of 
	the Miller-Rabin test. If the number is greater than 10^36, then all witnesses
	in the range [2, 2*log(n)*log(log(n))] are tested. However, this is conjectural
	and only heuristic evidence exists for it. To certify that a number is actually
	prime, one needs to test all witnesses in the range [2, 2*log(n)^2]. However, 
	this is generally quite slow. 

	Arguments:
		n (:int) - the integer to be tested
		use_probabilistic (:bool) - flag to indicate whether to use the regular 
		                		   version of the Miller-Rabin primality test
		tolerance (:int) - number of trials to be used to test primality

	Returns:
		True if 'n' is prime (or probably prime) and False otherwise

	Todo:
		Check for improved SPRP bases.
